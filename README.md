# Discord-Bots
Messing around with discord.py and discord.js to make discord bots :)

This is a copy of my files from back in 2019-2020 when i used to mess around with discord bots
feel free to take em, no longer interested ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Keep in mind:
all discord bot access tokens found on this repo have been terminated/expired.

Most discord.js files seen here weren't mine and i copy pasted them to see how they work

All discord.py bots will no longer work as the API has been updated to a newer version
they will need maintaining to work again, I'm not interested in approaching that at this time

## If you want to contribute to this repo, be my guest, I'll approve any pull requests coming through :)
